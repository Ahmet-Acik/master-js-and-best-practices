# To-Do App (CLI Version)

This is a minimal, original to-do app implemented in pure JavaScript for the command line (no frameworks, no DOM, no browser code).

## Features
- Add tasks
- List tasks
- Mark tasks as complete

## How to Run

```sh
node todo.js
```

## How to Extend
- Add persistence (save/load to file)
- Add delete/edit features
- Add a simple text-based menu for user input

This project demonstrates how to separate logic from UI and is a great starting point for more advanced apps.
